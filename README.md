ICON GENERATOR
==============

This is a *Simple* command line Script to Generate some system folder such as `Recycle Bin`, `My Computer` (`Which is not on the desktop of later version of windows : Windows 8, Windows 8.1`), and many other things. In fact, you can generate **21** types of icon with this script.

Files
-----

1. icongen.py `Main Program File`
2. icon.txt   `A list of Windows CLSID folder names`

Usage 
-----

Just Download both files and run icongen.py

**Requirement**
-----------

Python (You can get it from [python.org](http://www.python.org))
Windows Operation System

Notice
------

This Script is Written in `python 2.7` so, there might be some problem with `python 3` and above. And this, by *no* means will work in Linux/MAC Operation System. I used Windows 8.1 Environment to write this script, and there are some shortcut not working on `windows 8.1`. I don't know if this is just not working on windows 8. So please report me if things are not working as they should.

Bug Reports will be appreciated.
